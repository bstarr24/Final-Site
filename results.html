      <h1><strong>Results</strong></h1>
		<p>At Starr Landworks, we take pride in delivering outstanding results for farmers

		experienced after using our services:</P>

		<h2><strong>Success Stories</strong></h2>
		<ul>
		<li><h5>Case Study: Expanding Usable Land for a Rancher</h5>
		<p>After clearing 25 acres of overgrown brush, our team helped a local rancher 
		gain an additional 20 acres of usable grazing land. The eco-friendly treatments 
		applied post-clearing reduced regrowth, allowing the property owner to focus more 
		on livestock management instead of repeated clearing.</p></li>
		<li><h5>Case Study: Expanding Hunting Grounds</h5>
		<p>A recreational property owner wanted to create a more accessible hunting area on 
		his land. We cleared dense cedar and underbrush from 20 acres, creating open spaces 
		for wildlife management. The client saw a noticeable increase in game activity, 
		enhancing the property’s value as a hunting destination.</p></li>
		</ul>
